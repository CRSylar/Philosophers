philosophers project for 42 Rome

This project point to give to the student a better understanding on how threads works, how CPU manage them and what's the
differences between threads and processes.

Basing on the "famous" problem of the philosopher eating something where at least 2 forks is needed for each to eat but there's 
just one fork per philosopher, so we have to handle the DEADlock and the STARVATION using the thread creation and mutex / semaphore
